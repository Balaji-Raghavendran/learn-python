# To install Python on a PC, here are the basic prerequisites and steps:

### 1. **Operating System**
   - **Windows**: Versions 7, 8, 10, and 11 are supported.
   - **Linux**: Most distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora) come with Python pre-installed, but you can install the latest version.
   - **macOS**: Python 2.x is pre-installed, but it is recommended to install the latest Python 3.x version.

### 2. **System Requirements**
   - **Processor**: Python runs on all processors (x86, x64, ARM) commonly used in modern PCs.
   - **RAM**: 512 MB or more (depending on the Python applications you plan to run).
   - **Disk Space**: 200 MB of free disk space for the base installation.

### 3. **Python Version**
   Download the latest version from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), usually the stable release of Python 3.x.

### 4. **Administrator Privileges**
   For installation, you may need administrator rights to add Python to the system path and install it properly.

### 5. **Optional: Text Editor/IDE**
   - **Text Editors**: Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
   - **IDEs**: PyCharm, Visual Studio, or Eclipse with PyDev plugin.
   
### 6. **Ensure Environment Variables Are Set (Windows)**
   During installation, you can check the option "Add Python to PATH" to automatically set the environment variables. This allows you to run Python from the command line without specifying the full installation path.

### 7. **Python Package Manager (pip)**
   - Comes with Python by default (version 3.4 and above). It allows you to install additional packages and libraries.

Once these prerequisites are met, Python can be installed easily by running the downloaded installer file and following the on-screen instructions.
